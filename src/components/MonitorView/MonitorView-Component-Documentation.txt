MonitorView Component Structure Documentation
This document explains the purpose and function of each file in the MonitorView component folder to assist with future edits and maintenance.
Main Files
MonitorView.js
The main component that manages the state and coordinates all the sub-components. It:

Initializes and maintains the component state
Handles window resizing and mobile detection
Contains methods for toggling monitor view, screensaver, and screen power
Manages zoom levels and viewport colors
Orchestrates the rendering of sub-components
Creates the main portal for the monitor content

_styles.scss
Contains all the CSS styles for the MonitorView and its sub-components, including:

Monitor frame and screen styling
CRT effects
Control buttons
Screensaver containers
Clippy integration specific styles

index.js
Simple export file that allows importing the MonitorView component with a cleaner import path:
javascriptimport MonitorView from './MonitorView';
MonitorControlsPanel.js
A component that renders the control panel for adjusting monitor settings:

Toggle monitor visibility
Enable/disable screensavers
Control zoom levels
Set viewframe colors
Change active screensaver

ThemeWrapper.js
Provides theming support for the control panel, ensuring consistent styling across the application.
Component Sub-Folder
components/ClippyIntegration.js
Handles integration between Clippy and the monitor's power state:

Notifies Clippy when screen power changes
Observes the black overlay to detect power state changes
Adds necessary CSS for Clippy to respect the screen power state
Manages z-index hierarchy for proper layering of UI elements
Ensures Clippy and its elements are hidden when screen is off

components/CRTModeToggle.js
A reusable toggle button component for CRT mode and other toggleable options:

Supports both image and text based toggles
Handles active/inactive states
Provides consistent toggle button styling

components/MonitorButton.js
A simple button component for monitor controls:

Standard styling for all monitor control buttons
Handles active/inactive states
Provides consistent button appearance

components/MonitorControls.js
Contains the specific controls that appear on the monitor frame:

Power button
CRT effect toggle
Power indicator light
Positions all controls in their correct locations

components/MonitorFrame.js
Renders the monitor frame and screen containing the desktop content:

Renders the monitor image
Contains the screen viewport
Manages the black overlay for power off state
Handles CRT effect and other visual treatments
Includes the desktop content (children)

components/ScreensaverRenderer.js
Manages the rendering of all screensavers:

Creates and manages all portal elements for the screensavers
Renders different screensavers based on active state
Handles cleanup of screensaver elements on unmount
Conditionally renders the appropriate screensaver

Flow of Operation

MonitorView initializes state and creates portal containers
It renders ScreensaverRenderer for screensavers, the monitor content via portal, and MonitorControlsPanel
The monitor content includes MonitorFrame which renders the monitor, screen, and MonitorControls
ClippyIntegration runs in parallel to monitor UI changes to Clippy's visibility
User interactions with MonitorControls or MonitorControlsPanel update the state in MonitorView
State changes trigger re-rendering of appropriate components

Making Changes
When making changes to the MonitorView component, consider:

State changes: Most state should be managed in MonitorView.js
UI updates: Modify the appropriate component for the UI element you want to change
Style changes: Update _styles.scss for global styles or component-specific styles
New functionality: Add to the appropriate component or create a new one if needed
Clippy integration: Modify ClippyIntegration.js for any changes to Clippy behavior

Common Edit Scenarios

Adding a new monitor control: Add to MonitorControls.js
Changing screen appearance: Modify MonitorFrame.js
Adding a new screensaver: Update ScreensaverRenderer.js
Modifying Clippy integration: Edit ClippyIntegration.js
Adding a new monitor setting: Add state in MonitorView.js and UI in MonitorControlsPanel.js
