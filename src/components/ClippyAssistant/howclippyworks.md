## Overall Architecture

The Clippy implementation consists of several interconnected modules:

- **ClippyPositioning.js**: The single source of truth for all Clippy positioning, including zoom-aware, mobile, and overlay logic.
- **ZoomAwareResizeHandler**: Handles real-time resize and zoom-level anchor caching.
- **CustomBalloon.js**: Manages all speech balloons (statements, tips, errors, help, etc.) using direct DOM manipulation.
- **ChatBalloon.js**: Manages persistent chat balloons with user interaction tracking.
- **ClippyProvider.js**: (If present) React context provider for global state.
- **CustomBalloon.scss**: Styles for all balloons, including iOS Safari and mobile fixes.

---

## Core Interaction Flow

1. **Initialization**
   - ClippyPositioning calculates initial position based on device and zoom.
   - Overlay is auto-detected and positioned.
   - Device type and browser are detected for compatibility.

2. **Positioning**
   - All positioning logic is centralized in ClippyPositioning.js.
   - Mobile and desktop logic are separated and optimized.
   - Overlay is always synchronized with Clippy's position.

3. **Balloon Handling**
   - Only one balloon (speech or chat) can be open at a time.
   - Speech balloons are auto-closed after a timeout; chat balloons persist after user interaction.
   - The "How may I help you?" enhanced message balloon with 4 buttons is fully removed.

4. **Resize & Zoom**
   - Real-time resize and zoom handling via requestAnimationFrame.
   - Zoom-aware anchor caching for desktop.
   - iOS Safari and mobile-specific viewport handling.

---

## Positioning System

- **Centralized in ClippyPositioning.js**
  - All calculations for Clippy and overlay positions are performed here.
  - Handles both mobile (fixed, responsive) and desktop (zoom-aware, anchored) logic.
  - Overlay is always matched to Clippy's position and size.

- **Zoom-Aware Anchoring**
  - Desktop positions are cached per zoom level for instant repositioning.
  - Hybrid 4-phase system: movement detection, positioning, validation, correction.

- **Mobile Positioning**
  - Responsive to viewport size, safe areas, and browser quirks (iOS Safari, Google App).
  - Touch targets and safe area insets are respected.

---

## Balloon System

- **Speech Balloons (`custom-clippy-balloon`)**
  - Used for close-ended statements, tips, errors, and welcome messages.
  - May include buttons for help, tips, or error actions.
  - The "How may I help you?" enhanced message balloon with 4 buttons is fully blocked and cannot appear.

- **Chat Balloons (`custom-clippy-chat-balloon`)**
  - Used for interactive chat with Clippy.
  - Becomes persistent after user interaction (typing, clicking input, sending message).
  - Only one chat balloon can be open at a time.

- **Balloon Management**
  - Only one balloon (speech or chat) can be open at a time.
  - Balloons are managed via direct DOM manipulation for compatibility and performance.
  - All balloon positioning is handled by ClippyPositioning.

---

## Animation System

- **Safe Animation Execution**
  - All animations are logged and wrapped for debugging.
  - Animations are only played if Clippy is visible.
  - Animations and balloons are mutually exclusive per interaction (never both at once).

---

## User Interactions

- **Mobile**
  - Single tap: Animation (2/3) or speech balloon (1/3).
  - Double tap: Opens chat balloon.
  - Long press: Unlocks for dragging.
  - Drag: Only when unlocked, auto-locks on drop.

- **Desktop**
  - Double click: Animation (2/3) or speech balloon (1/3).
  - Right click: Shows context menu for agent/animation options.

- **Balloon Persistence**
  - Speech balloons auto-close after 6 seconds.
  - Chat balloons persist after user interaction until manually closed.

- **Interaction Blocking**
  - Cooldown after any interaction (1.5s).
  - No new balloons if one is open.
  - No new interactions while animation is playing.

---

## Device Detection & iOS Safari Compatibility

- **Device Detection**
  - Mobile detection uses user agent, screen size, and touch capability.
  - iOS Safari and Google App are specifically detected for quirks.

- **iOS Safari Fixes**
  - All text uses `-webkit-text-fill-color: #000000 !important` to prevent blue text.
  - Touch targets are â‰¥44px.
  - Inputs use 16px font to prevent zoom.
  - Hardware acceleration (`transform: translateZ(0)`) is applied to all key elements.

---

## Real-time Resize Handling

- **ZoomAwareResizeHandler**
  - Uses requestAnimationFrame for real-time monitoring.
  - Caches anchor positions per zoom level.
  - Notifies listeners on resize, zoom, and orientation changes.
  - Handles iOS Safari viewport quirks.

- **Performance**
  - Zero drift during resize.
  - Overlay always synchronized.
  - All updates are immediate (no CSS transitions during resize).

---

## Common Issues and Solutions

- **Speech balloon with "How may I help you?" and 4 buttons**: Fully blocked in code, cannot appear.
- **Blue text on iOS Safari**: Fixed with `-webkit-text-fill-color`.
- **Clippy drifting during resize/zoom**: Fixed with zoom-aware anchor caching and real-time monitoring.
- **Overlay out of sync**: Overlay is always repositioned with Clippy.
- **Multiple balloons open**: Only one balloon (speech or chat) can be open at a time.

---

## Testing & Verification

- **Manual Testing**
  - Interact with Clippy on both desktop and mobile.
  - Resize and zoom the window; Clippy and overlay should remain anchored.
  - Open and close speech and chat balloons; only one should be visible at a time.
  - Try to trigger the "How may I help you?" balloon; it should never appear.

- **Automated Testing**
  - Use browser console to call exported functions and verify behavior.
  - Check for correct positioning, overlay sync, and balloon persistence.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Clippy not visible**: Check for startup/shutdown sequence hiding, or CSS display/visibility.
- **Balloon not appearing**: Ensure no other balloon is open and cooldown is not active.
- **Overlay not matching Clippy**: Call `ClippyPositioning.positionOverlay()` to resync.
- **Position drift**: Call `ClippyPositioning.positionCorrection()` for correction.

---

## Architecture Benefits

- **Single source of truth** for all positioning logic.
- **Centralized balloon management** for all speech and chat balloons.
- **Real-time, zoom-aware, and mobile-optimized** positioning.
- **Comprehensive iOS Safari compatibility**.
- **Crash-resistant and easy to debug** with logging and error handling.
- **Performance-optimized** for both desktop and mobile.

---

## Emergency Recovery Options

- **Standard Reset**:  
  `window.resetClippy();`

- **Emergency Reset**:  
  `window.ClippyService?.emergencyReset?.();`

- **Nuclear Option**:  
  `window.killClippy(); // Then refresh the page`

- **4-Phase System Reset**:  
  ```js
  const clippyEl = document.querySelector(".clippy");
  const currentZoom = ClippyPositioning.getCurrentZoomLevel();
  ClippyPositioning.hybridZoomPositioning(clippyEl, currentZoom);
  ```

- **Real-time System Reset**:  
  ```js
  const clippyEl = document.querySelector(".clippy");
  const overlayEl = document.getElementById("clippy-clickable-overlay");
  ClippyPositioning.stopResizeHandling(clippyEl);
  ClippyPositioning.startResizeHandling(clippyEl, overlayEl);
  ```

The enhanced system ensures reliable, performant, and user-friendly behavior across all devices and browsers.**

## Nuanced Features: Mobile Browser Positioning Rules

- **Device & Browser Detection:**  
  ClippyPositioning uses user agent, screen size, and touch capability to detect mobile devices. It further distinguishes iOS Safari and the Google iOS App for special handling.

- **Safe Area Insets:**  
  On modern mobile devices (especially iOS), Clippy respects safe area insets (notches, home indicators) by reading `env(safe-area-inset-*)` CSS variables and adjusting its position to avoid overlap.

- **Taskbar & Notification Area Awareness:**  
  On mobile, Clippy attempts to detect the presence and position of the taskbar or notification area (e.g., `.TaskBar__notifications`) and adjusts its bottom offset accordingly.

- **Browser-Specific Adjustments:**  
  - **iOS Safari:** Adds extra bottom padding to avoid the browser's UI chrome.
  - **Google App on iOS:** Applies a different offset to visually match Safari.
  - **Chrome on iOS:** Detects `CriOS` in the user agent and tweaks position.

- **Viewport Constraints:**  
  Clippy's position is always constrained to the visible viewport, never allowing it to be off-screen. This includes dynamic calculations for right and bottom offsets based on the current viewport size and Clippy's dimensions.

- **Touch Target Compliance:**  
  The overlay and Clippy's clickable area are expanded to ensure a minimum of 44px touch targets, meeting iOS accessibility guidelines.

- **Zoom Prevention:**  
  Inputs in balloons use a minimum font size of 16px to prevent iOS Safari from zooming the viewport when focused.

- **Real-time Repositioning:**  
  On orientation change, resize, or visual viewport changes (such as the keyboard appearing), Clippy and its overlay are repositioned in real time to remain visible and accessible.

- **Hardware Acceleration:**  
  All positioning uses `transform: translateZ(0)` and related CSS for smooth, GPU-accelerated movement, reducing jank on mobile browsers.

- **No Drift During Resize:**  
  The system uses `requestAnimationFrame` to monitor and correct Clippy's position during window or viewport changes, ensuring it never drifts out of place.

- **Single Source of Truth:**  
  All these rules are centralized in `ClippyPositioning.js`, ensuring consistent behavior across all mobile browsers and devices.
