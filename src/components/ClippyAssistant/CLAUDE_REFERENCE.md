### Testing & Verification

```
Run updated tests to verify real-time resize handling:
- console-test-runner.js - Tests real-time resize positioning performance
- performanceTest.js - Tests ClippyPositioning system performance
- verification-test.js - Verifies all centralized system methods

All tests now validate:
- Real-time resize event handling (no throttling)
- Anchored positioning accuracy during window resize
- Position stability (no drift during active resize)
- CSS performance optimizations for real-time updates
- Mobile/desktop positioning calculations
- Synchronized overlay positioning
```

## üéØ ClippyAssistant Component Rules

### Positioning System

- **ALL positioning logic** goes in `ClippyPositioning.js` (single source of truth)
- **Mobile**: `bottom: 120px, right: 11px` with responsive calculations
- **Desktop**: Anchored to desktop viewport with percentage-based scaling
- **Real-time resize**: Uses `requestAnimationFrame` monitoring for instant updates
- **Never** add positioning logic to CSS or other JS files

### Real-time Resize Handling

- **No throttling/debouncing** - updates happen every frame during resize
- **Anchored positioning** - Clippy stays locked to desktop viewport percentage
- **CSS optimizations** - All transitions removed during resize for instant updates
- **Performance monitoring** - Real-time drift detection and performance metrics

### File Structure

- `ClippyPositioning.js` - All positioning calculations + real-time resize handling
- `ClippyProvider.js` - Main state management and global functions
- `ClippyService.js` - API for external components
- `ClippyAssistant.js` - UI component
- Custom balloons and utilities in separate files

### Key Principles

- Mobile-first development
- Real-time visual stability during window resize
- Crash resistance (always include error handling)
- Performance optimization (especially mobile)
- Centralized logic to avoid scattered code

## üîß Common Error Fixes

### ‚úÖ Real-time Resize Drift (LATEST FIX)

**Issue:** Clippy drifts toward bottom-right during active window resizing, only snaps back when resize stops.

**Root Cause:** Throttled/debounced resize events caused delayed position updates during active resize.

**Solution Applied:**

```javascript
// ‚ùå Before: Throttled resize handling
handleResize() {
  if (this.resizeTimeout) clearTimeout(this.resizeTimeout);
  this.resizeTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
    this.notifyListeners("resize", data);
  }, isMobile ? 150 : 100); // Delayed updates
}

// ‚úÖ After: Real-time monitoring with requestAnimationFrame
checkForResize() {
  const currentWidth = window.innerWidth;
  const currentHeight = window.innerHeight;

  if (currentWidth !== this.lastWidth || currentHeight !== this.lastHeight) {
    // Immediate notification for real-time updates
    this.notifyListeners("realtime-resize", data);
    this.lastWidth = currentWidth;
    this.lastHeight = currentHeight;
  }

  this.animationFrameId = requestAnimationFrame(this.checkForResize);
}
```

**Key Changes:**

- Replaced throttled setTimeout with requestAnimationFrame loop
- Added percentage-based anchor positioning for better scaling
- Removed all CSS transitions during resize for instant visual updates
- Added `clippy-anchored` CSS class for performance optimizations

### ‚úÖ CSS Performance Optimizations (LATEST)

**Applied optimizations for real-time resize:**

```scss
// Remove all transitions during resize
.clippy {
  transition: none !important;
}

// Special anchored state for maximum performance
.clippy.clippy-anchored {
  transform-style: preserve-3d !important;
  contain: layout style paint !important;
  isolation: isolate !important;
  transition: none !important;
  animation: none !important;
}
```

### ‚úÖ React Hook Dependency Warnings (FIXED)

**Issues Fixed:**

- Missing dependencies in useEffect arrays
- Ref cleanup timing warnings
- tapTimeoutRef access violations

**Solutions Applied:**

```javascript
// ‚ùå Before: Missing dependencies
useEffect(() => {
  // Uses clippyInstanceRef, overlayRef, tapTimeoutRef
}, [clippy, visible]);

// ‚úÖ After: Complete dependencies
useEffect(() => {
  const currentTapTimeout = tapTimeoutRef.current; // Copy ref value

  return () => {
    if (currentTapTimeout) {
      // Use copied value
      clearTimeout(currentTapTimeout);
    }
  };
}, [clippy, visible, clippyInstanceRef, overlayRef, tapTimeoutRef]);
```

### ‚úÖ Test File Syntax Errors (FIXED)

**Issues Fixed:**

- Undefined variables in test files
- Missing variable declarations
- Browser API availability checks
- Duplicate code sections

**Solutions Applied:**

```javascript
// ‚ùå Before: Undefined variables
if (hasValidPosition) passedTests++; // Error

// ‚úÖ After: Proper declarations
let hasValidPosition = false;
let overlayPosition = null;
let animationSuccess = false;
// Then use them safely
```
