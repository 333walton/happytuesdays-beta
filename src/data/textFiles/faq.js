Frequently Asked Questions:
===========================

Why does the screen flicker?

→ That’s a CRT effect to make it feel like an old-school monitor! If you feel a seizure coming on, you can adjust it in Control Panel settings.


Why is the screen size weird?

→ Because monitors were square (4:3 aspect ratio) in the 90s. Start > Settings > Control Panel to adjust.


Can I delete files?

→ Not yet! But if you’re really determined, you can clear your browser’s local storage and pretend you’re a 90s IT pro.


Can I play the launch screen again?

→ Yes, just go through the shutdown sequence, and you’ll see it again on refresh.
