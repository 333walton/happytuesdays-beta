Frequently Asked Questions:
===========================

🖥️ DISPLAY & VISUALS

Why does the screen flicker?
→ That's a CRT effect to recreate the authentic old-school monitor experience! 
If the flickering bothers you or triggers sensitivity, you can adjust or disable it in Control Panel settings.

Why is the screen size weird?
→ We're recreating the classic 4:3 aspect ratio that was standard in the 90s! Square monitors were the norm back then. You can adjust display settings via Start > Settings > Control Panel.

Can I go fullscreen?
→ Use F11 in most browsers, or look for fullscreen options in your browser menu. Some browsers may have different shortcuts.

Why are the colors so vibrant?
→ That's the authentic Windows 98 color scheme! You can change themes and wallpapers by right-clicking the desktop.


💾 FILES & STORAGE

Can I delete files?
→ File deletion isn't implemented yet, but you can clear your browser's local storage to reset everything and channel your inner 90s system administrator!

Do my saved files persist?
→ Yes! Files saved in apps like Notepad and Paint are stored in your browser's local storage and will be there when you return.

Can I upload my own files?
→ Some applications support file uploads - look for "Open" options in programs like Paint and text editors.

How much storage space do I have?
→ Storage depends on your browser's local storage limits, typically 5-10MB. Think of it as a nostalgic floppy disk experience!


🎮 PROGRAMS & GAMES

Which programs actually work?
→ Most programs are fully functional! Notepad, Paint, Calculator, Minesweeper, Internet Explorer, and many others work just like the originals.

Can I install new software?
→ This is a web-based recreation, so you can't install traditional software. However, there are plenty of built-in programs to explore!

Why do some programs feel slow?
→ We've authentically recreated that classic 90s computing experience! Some intentional delays make it feel more nostalgic.

Are the games really playable?
→ Absolutely! Minesweeper, Solitaire, and other games are fully playable with the same rules as the originals.


🤖 CLIPPY & AI ASSISTANTS

How do I interact with Clippy?
→ Desktop: Single-click for animations/tips, double-click to chat, right-click for menu

Can I change to a different assistant?
→ Yes! Right-click Clippy and select "Select AI Agent" to choose from Bonzi, Genie, Merlin, Links, or Rover.

Why isn't Clippy responding?
→ Check if any balloons are already open (only one can be open at a time). There's also a 3-second cooldown between interactions.

Can I move Clippy around?
→ Yes! Drag Clippy to reposition. On mobile, you may need to unlock the position first via the mobile controls.


🌐 INTERNET & BROWSING

Does Internet Explorer actually browse the web?
→ Yes! It's a fully functional browser that can visit real websites, complete with that classic IE interface.

Why do some modern websites look broken?
→ We're using a retro browser interface! Some modern web features weren't available in 1998, adding to the authentic experience.

Can I set a homepage?
→ Look for browser settings within Internet Explorer to customize your browsing experience.


⚙️ SYSTEM & SETTINGS

How do I access system settings?

How do I shut down properly?
→ Use Start > Shut Down for the authentic shutdown sequence, complete with the classic "It is now safe to turn off your computer" screen.


🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

A program isn't responding, what do I do?
→ Press Ctrl+Alt+Del to open Task Manager, just like the old days! You can force-close unresponsive programs there.

The system seems frozen, help!
→ Try refreshing the browser page. Your saved files should still be there thanks to local storage!

Sound isn't working?
→ Check your browser's sound settings. Some browsers require user interaction before allowing audio to play.

Can I play the startup screen again?
→ Go through the complete shutdown sequence (Start > Shut Down), then refresh the page to see the full boot experience again!
