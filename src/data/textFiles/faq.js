╚════════════════════════════════════════╝

🖥️ Why does the screen flicker?
→ That's a CRT effect to recreate the authentic 
  old-school monitor experience! If the flickering
  bothers you or triggers sensitivity, you can 
  adjust or disable it in Control Panel settings.

🖥️ Why is the screen size weird?
→ We're recreating the classic 4:3 aspect ratio that
  was standard in the 90s! Square monitors were the
  norm back then. The developer really nailed the 
  authentic proportions.

🖥️ Can I go fullscreen?
→ Use F11 in most browsers, or look for fullscreen
  options in your browser menu. Some browsers may 
  have different shortcuts.

🎨 Why are the colors so vibrant?
→ That's the authentic Windows 98 color scheme! You
  can change themes and wallpapers by right-clicking
  the desktop.

║                 FILES & STORAGE                ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════╝

💾 Can I delete files?
→ File deletion isn't implemented yet, but you can
  clear your browser's local storage to reset 
  everything and channel your inner 90s system 
  administrator!

💾 Do my saved files persist?
→ Yes! Files saved in apps like Notepad and Paint are
  stored in your browser's local storage and will be
  there when you return. Modern convenience meets 
  retro charm!

📂 Can I upload my own files?
→ Some applications support file uploads - look for
  "Open" options in programs like Paint and text 
  editors.

💿 How much storage space do I have?
→ Storage depends on your browser's local storage 
  limits, typically 5-10MB. Think of it as a 
  nostalgic floppy disk experience!

║                 PROGRAMS & GAMES               ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════╝

🎮 Which programs actually work?
→ Most programs are fully functional! Notepad, Paint,
  Calculator, Minesweeper, Internet Explorer, and 
  many others work just like the originals. The 
  developer really went all-out on authenticity.

💿 Can I install new software?
→ This is a web-based recreation, so you can't install
  traditional software. However, there are plenty of
  built-in programs to explore!

⏳ Why do some programs feel slow?
→ We've authentically recreated that classic 90s 
  computing experience! Some intentional delays make
  it feel more nostalgic.

🎯 Are the games really playable?
→ Absolutely! Minesweeper, Solitaire, and other games
  are fully playable with the same rules as the 
  originals.

  flicker and CRT distortion effects. Perfect for

  features that aren't easily accessible through 
  traditional desktop interactions.

🌐 What about Internet Explorer?
→ Internet Explorer includes recreations of classic
  websites like MySpace for that authentic late 90s/
  early 2000s browsing experience!
